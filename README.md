# Fantasy Stat Track
Track statistics from your NFL Fanstasy League

 The application's goal is to create and automate a process for NFL Fantasy player data collection, as well improve the research tools available for people who use NFL Fantasy(primarily myself and friends).

Statistics help determine future draft, trade, and waiver-wire decisions of current and future seasons for those who participate in all fantasy sports. 
  - Future goals include visualizing the data, creating insights, getting information from multiple seasons and adding end-user support.

Requirements: 
  - NFL Fantasy Account with at least one league season 
  - MongoDB Atlas account 


This application is in no way sponsored and/or endorsed by NFL Fantasy
